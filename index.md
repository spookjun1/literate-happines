  <h3><span class="custom-font-1-hairline custom-font-1-thin">My cuisine</span></h3>
  <h5 class="uppercase">COOKING FOR ME IS LISTENING TO THE CALL OF THE PLACES I GREW UP IN: THE SMELL OF THE SEA,<span class="facy-underscore facy-underline fancy-underline">THE SCENT OF LEMONS</span>, OF HOME.</h5>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Inspiration comes from memories but skill comes from hard work, long nights spent in the kitchen and true passion for a very demanding profession that may not automatically bring rewards for all your efforts. Like in life itself, a meeting point is everything: between north and south, sea and mountains &ndash; the secret is balance.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t feel as if I were an innovator, I go in-depth, losing myself in flavours that come from tradition, trying to bring a new form to life while respecting each ingredient.</p>
